tree-sitter-fortran
==================

Fortran grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter). Adapted from [this Fortran grammar](http://slebok.github.io/zoo/index.html#fortran_f90_waite-cordy).
This fork provides naive implementations of functions from `ctype.h` and `wctype.h` to make Zed's wasm build happy; it is recommended to use the original repo for any other use case.
